# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Distributed Key-Value Store project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, consequences, and rationale.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand:

- What decisions were made and why
- The context and constraints at the time
- The consequences and trade-offs
- Alternative options that were considered

## ADR Format

We use the following structure for our ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Description of the issue and context]

## Decision
[The architectural decision that was made]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other options that were evaluated]

## References
[Links to related documents or discussions]
```

## Guidelines for New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. **Use the next sequential number**: Check the index above for the next available number
2. **Use descriptive titles**: Make it clear what decision is being documented
3. **Be specific about context**: Include relevant constraints and requirements
4. **Document alternatives**: Show what other options were considered
5. **Explain consequences**: Both positive and negative impacts
6. **Update the index**: Add your ADR to the table above
7. **Link related ADRs**: Reference other ADRs that relate to your decision

## Updating ADRs

- **Never modify accepted ADRs**: Create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- **Mark superseded ADRs**: Update the status and add a reference to the superseding ADR
- **Deprecate obsolete decisions**: Mark ADRs as deprecated when they no longer apply

## Review Process

1. Create ADR in "Proposed" status
2. Share with team for review and discussion
3. Incorporate feedback and revisions
4. Change status to "Accepted" when team agrees
5. Implement the decision
6. Monitor consequences and update if needed
