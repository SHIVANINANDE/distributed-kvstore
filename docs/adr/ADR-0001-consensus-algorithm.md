# ADR-0001: Raft Consensus Algorithm Selection

## Status
Accepted

Date: 2024-01-15

## Context

The distributed key-value store requires a consensus algorithm to ensure data consistency across multiple nodes in the cluster. The system needs to handle:

- Leader election in case of node failures
- Log replication to maintain consistency
- Partition tolerance during network splits
- Strong consistency guarantees for write operations

Key requirements:
- Proven algorithm with strong theoretical foundations
- Available implementations in Go
- Good performance characteristics for key-value workloads
- Clear leader-follower model for simplified client interaction
- Ability to handle dynamic cluster membership

## Decision

We will use the **Raft consensus algorithm** as the foundation for distributed consensus in our key-value store.

### Implementation Details

1. **Custom Raft Implementation**: We will implement Raft ourselves rather than using existing libraries to have full control over optimizations
2. **Log Structure**: Design log entries specifically for key-value operations
3. **Batching**: Implement log entry batching for improved throughput
4. **Snapshots**: Support periodic snapshots for log compaction
5. **Membership Changes**: Support safe dynamic cluster membership changes

### Specific Raft Optimizations

- **Pre-vote Phase**: Implement pre-vote to reduce unnecessary elections
- **Pipelining**: Use pipelining for log replication to improve performance
- **Batched Operations**: Batch multiple client operations into single log entries
- **Leader Stickiness**: Implement mechanisms to maintain stable leadership

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Proven Algorithm**: Raft is well-understood with formal proofs of correctness
- **Strong Consistency**: Provides linearizable consistency for write operations
- **Operational Simplicity**: Clear leader-follower model simplifies debugging and monitoring
- **Partition Tolerance**: Handles network partitions gracefully with majority quorum
- **Active Community**: Large body of research and implementations to learn from

### Negative
- **Write Scalability**: Single leader becomes a bottleneck for write operations
- **Implementation Complexity**: Custom implementation requires careful attention to edge cases
- **Network Overhead**: Consensus requires additional network communication
- **Latency Impact**: Consensus adds latency to write operations due to majority acknowledgment
- **Brain Split Risk**: Minority partitions become unavailable during network splits

### Performance Implications
- **Write Latency**: +1-5ms additional latency for consensus
- **Read Performance**: Leader reads have no consensus overhead, follower reads may have slight delay
- **Throughput**: Write throughput limited to ~50-100K ops/sec depending on network and hardware
- **Network Usage**: ~2x network overhead for log replication

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Paxos Algorithm
**Pros:**
- Theoretically well-founded
- Proven in production systems (Google Spanner)

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement correctly
- Less intuitive for debugging and operations
- Multiple variants with different trade-offs

**Verdict:** Rejected due to implementation complexity

### 2. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Algorithms
**Pros:**
- Handles malicious node behavior
- Strongest fault tolerance guarantees

**Cons:**
- Much higher overhead (3f+1 nodes needed for f faults)
- More complex implementation
- Not needed for our trust model

**Verdict:** Rejected as overkill for our use case

### 3. Eventually Consistent Systems (Gossip, Vector Clocks)
**Pros:**
- Higher availability during partitions
- Better performance and scalability
- Lower network overhead

**Cons:**
- Complex conflict resolution
- No strong consistency guarantees
- More complex client programming model

**Verdict:** Rejected due to consistency requirements

### 4. Multi-Paxos or Chain Replication
**Pros:**
- Good performance characteristics
- Proven in some production systems

**Cons:**
- Less mature ecosystem
- More complex failure handling
- Limited availability of reference implementations

**Verdict:** Rejected in favor of Raft's simplicity

### 5. Existing Raft Libraries (etcd/raft, Dragonboat)
**Pros:**
- Battle-tested implementations
- Faster time to market
- Less implementation risk

**Cons:**
- Limited control over optimizations
- May include unnecessary features
- Harder to customize for our specific use case

**Verdict:** Rejected to maintain full control over performance optimizations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Raft Implementation
1. Leader election algorithm
2. Log replication
3. Safety guarantees
4. Basic cluster membership

### Phase 2: Optimizations
1. Log compaction and snapshots
2. Batching and pipelining
3. Pre-vote implementation
4. Performance tuning

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Dynamic membership changes
2. Leader transfer
3. Read-only replica support
4. Cross-region replication

## Validation

The decision will be validated through:

1. **Correctness Testing**: Jepsen-style testing for linearizability
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: Latency and throughput measurements
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Chaos engineering testing
4. **Operational Experience**: Real-world deployment feedback
